## Using the RWU Style

You can also use the RWU for other purposes with the mixin provided in the stylesheet. For example, you can add the RWU to all comments by adding the following to your `styles.less`:

```less
@import "packages/red-wavy-underline/styles/red-wavy-underline";

.syntax--comment {
  .red-wavy-underline;
}
```
